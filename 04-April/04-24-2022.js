// Task
// Given three integers a ,b ,c, return the largest number obtained after inserting the following operators and brackets: +, *, ()
// In other words , try every combination of a,b,c with [*+()] , and return the Maximum Obtained
// Consider an Example :
// With the numbers are 1, 2 and 3 , here are some ways of placing signs and brackets:

// 1 * (2 + 3) = 5
// 1 * 2 * 3 = 6
// 1 + 2 * 3 = 7
// (1 + 2) * 3 = 9
// So the maximum value that you can obtain is 9.

// Notes
// The numbers are always positive.
// The numbers are in the range (1  ≤  a, b, c  ≤  10).
// You can use the same operation more than once.
// It's not necessary to place all the signs and brackets.
// Repetition in numbers may occur .
// You cannot swap the operands. For instance, in the given example you cannot get expression (1 + 3) * 2 = 8.

const expressionMatter = (a, b, c) => {
    return Math.max(
        a + b + c,
        a * b * c,
        (a + b) * c,
        (a * b) + c,
        a + (b * c),
        a * (b + c),
)}

//*****I was able to get this kata on the first try (almost) i made a mistake with my commas within the Math.max() method. Other than that, I was right on it!!

// Nathan loves cycling.

// Because Nathan knows it is important to stay hydrated, he drinks 0.5 litres of water per hour of cycling.

// You get given the time in hours and you need to return the number of litres Nathan will drink, rounded to the smallest value.

// For example:

// time = 3 ----> litres = 1

// time = 6.7---> litres = 3

// time = 11.8--> litres = 5

const litres = time => Math.floor( time * .5)
