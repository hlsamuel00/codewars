// Debugging sayHello function
// The starship Enterprise has run into some problem when creating a program to greet everyone as they come aboard. It is your job to fix the code and get the program working again!

// Example output:

// Hello, Mr. Spock

function sayHello(name) {
    return 'Hello, ' + name
}

//*****I was able to get this kata challenge very easily. I also refactored the code to an arrow function below:

const sayHello = (name) => 'Hello, ' + name
