// Given a number n, return the number of positive odd numbers below n, EASY!

// Examples (Input -> Output)
// 7  -> 3 (because odd numbers below 7 are [1, 3, 5])
// 15 -> 7 (because odd numbers below 15 are [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13])


const oddCount = n => Math.floor(n/2)

//******I was able to get this kata fairly easily, but recognizing the patter is what saved me when focusing on larger numbers.
