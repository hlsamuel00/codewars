// You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" N.

// Examples
// [2, 4, 0, 100, 4, 11, 2602, 36]
// Should return: 11 (the only odd number)

// [160, 3, 1719, 19, 11, 13, -21]
// Should return: 160 (the only even number)

function findOutlier(integers){
    const odd = integers.filter(nums => nums % 2)
    const even = integers.filter(nums => !(nums % 2))
    return odd.length > 1 ? even[0] : odd[0]
