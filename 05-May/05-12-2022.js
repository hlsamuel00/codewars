// Your team is writing a fancy new text editor and you've been tasked with implementing the line numbering.

// Write a function which takes a list of strings and returns each line prepended by the correct number.

// The numbering starts at 1. The format is n: string. Notice the colon and space in between.

// Examples:

// number([]) // => []
// number(["a", "b", "c"]) // => ["1: a", "2: b", "3: c"]

const number = array => array.map((x,i) => `${i+1}: ${x}`)

//*****This kata challenge was a breeze.

// Your job is to create a class called Song.

// A new Song will take two parameters, title and artist.

// const mountMoose = new Song('Mount Moose', 'The Snazzy Moose');

// mountMoose.title => 'Mount Moose'
// mountMoose.artist => 'The Snazzy Moose'
// You will also have to create an instance method named howMany() (or how_many()).

// The method takes an array of people who have listened to the song that day. The output should be how many new listeners the song gained on that day out of all listeners. Names should be treated in a case-insensitive manner, i.e. "John" is the same as "john".

// Example
// const mountMoose = new Song('Mount Moose', 'The Snazzy Moose');

// // day 1 (or test 1)
// mountMoose.howMany(['John', 'Fred', 'BOb', 'carl', 'RyAn']); => 5
// // These are all new since they are the first listeners.

// // day 2
// mountMoose.howMany(['JoHn', 'Luke', 'AmAndA']); => 2
// // Luke and Amanda are new, john already listened to it the previous day
// Also if the same person listened to it more than once a day it should only count them once.

// Example
// const mountMoose = new Song('Mount Moose', 'The Snazzy Moose');

// // day 1
// mountMoose.howMany(['John', 'joHN', 'carl']); => 2
// Good luck!

// ****I wasn't able to get this kata challenge, but will review the solution i located that seems to be the best to understand:

class Song{
    constructor(title, artist){
      this.title = title;
      this.artist = artist;
      this.listener = new Set()
    };
    howMany(people){
      let oldSize = this.listener.size;
      people.map(p => this.listener.add(p.toLowerCase()));
      return this.listener.size - oldSize;
    }
  }
